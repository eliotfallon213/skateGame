# skateGame

A skate game written in Phaser (http://phaser.io).

The Skater will jump when the mouse is pressed and the object is to avoid the crates.

Please excuse the graphics, I put them together from a variety of places. It doesn't do too much, but it gave me a good opportunity to see how it works with sprites, sets up and preloads items and handles collisions.

##Installation

- Then open a CLI inside the directory you have cloned it to.
- Install the Node modules (npm install).
- Install the Bower packages (bower install)
- Using a Grunt task, run the Node server to open the application in your browser. (grunt serve).
