# skateGame

A skate game written in Phaser (http://phaser.io).

The Skater will jump when the mouse is pressed and the object is to avoid the crates.

Please excuse the graphics, I put them together from a variety of places. It doesn't do too much, but it gave me a good opportunity to see how it works with sprites, sets up and preloads items and handles collisions.

After playing around with PhysicsJS in one of my other repos, I attended a workshop run by Phaser.io (http://phaser.io/). As part of the workshop we were introduced to the Phaser framework and started putting together sprites and detecting collisions.

The game so far is in a rudimentary state, but in my next step I'd like to combine a Physics engine to determine the position of the sprites.
